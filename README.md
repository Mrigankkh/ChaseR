# ChaseR

An AI driven Unreal Engine 5 project done as coursework for the graduate course 'Game Artificial Intelligence' demonstrating advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and behavior tree techniques. This repository also documents the step-by-step learning and development process for multiple class assignments.

## Overview

**ChaseR** is a  **Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)** project that merges **C++** and **Blueprint**.

  The toy game starts with 2 basic characters- A **player** and an **evil R2D2 robot**. 

Throughout its development, the AI evolves from basic movement demos  of the robot to robust pathfinding and behavior trees. Some cool things that I implemented are:

- **Robust A\* pathfinding** (with path smoothing) navigating complex environments  
- **Dijkstra-driven positioning** empowering AI to hold, hide, or flee strategically  
- **Behavior Trees** orchestrating unique AI archetypes (Leader, Soldier, Fodder, etc.)  
- **Engaging player interaction**, complete with projectile combat and health systems  


## Implementation Overview

Each subsection in the implementation overview corresponds to a different assignment.

### Figure 8
Unreal Engine 5 is overwhelming to begin with and so thing I implemented was a simple figure-8 movement for the robot.  This was done through a simple sinusodial-like movement. The biggest challenge here was the **Drifting** problem wherein the bot would drift in direction while moving in the figure-8.

### A* Pathfinding and Chase Behavior
To enable **chase behavior**, I integrated A* pathfinding into the AI using the *UGAPathComponent*. The AI now dynamically calculates the best path towards the target. I implemented a custom **Line-Trace Algorithm** to ensure that the robot avoids any obstacles in its path. After the robot discovers a path, A **smoothing function** was added to ensure fluid movement along the path.

### Spatial Functions

used **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to calculate the shortest path to the target, creating a **distance map**. For each potential position, I evaluated **line-of-sight (LOS)**, **target distance**, and **path distance** in a separate **GridMap**.

These values were processed through the **spatial function's response curve** to determine the best position based on the AI's behavior, such as **hide**, **hold**, or **flee**. This allowed the AI to choose the optimal destination based on its current goal.
